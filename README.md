# Javacript Exercises — Variables, Data Types, Conditional Statements & Loops

## Overview
This project is a simple practice of basic JavaScript concepts divided into separate files:
- Variables
- Data Types & Operators
- Conditional Statements & Loops

Each section has multiple small exercises focusing on improving core JavaScript skills.

## Project Structure
```
/project-folder
  ├── variables.js
  ├── datatypes_operators.js
  └── conditionalStatements_loops.js
```

## What's inside each file
- **variables.js**  
  - Practice variable declarations, reassignments, and basic arithmetic operations.

- **datatypes_operators.js**  
  - Work with different data types like numbers and booleans.
  - Practice comparison, logical, and assignment operators.

- **conditionalStatements_loops.js**  
  - Write if-else, switch statements, and use different types of loops:
    - For loops
    - While loops
    - Do-while loops

## How to Run
1. Make sure Node.js is installed.
2. Run any file using:
   ```bash
   node filename.js
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   node variables.js
   ```

## Notes
- Focus is on **basic JavaScript logic**.
- All code is organized and separated for easy understanding.
- Great for beginners to practice fundamental concepts.
